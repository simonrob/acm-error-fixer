# ACM-error-fixer
Tired of ACM's aggressive blocking of direct links to PDFs, and frustrated at how difficult it is to get back to the original Digital Library source from this error page?

This simple Chrome Extension automatically redirects to the original Digital Library source from ACM's Access Denied error pages.

Install from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/afckhgfgejljgmplfenchnphecilmkck).
